This is test Repository Created to check GIT

Approach One 
    1. Create a public repository
    2. In your OS create a directory and clone the repository
    3. git add filename or git add file*.*
    4. git commit -m "Message - Initial Commit" - this will add the files to your local repository that you initiated in step 3
    5. create file named ".gitIgnore" - and all the files or extension you want to ignore from being added in to the repository
    6. add the .gitIgnore file to git and commit it
    7. git push
    8. Files from the .gitIgnore will not pushed and others will get end up in repo

Steps Involved
  1. Create a directroy in OS
  2. Place the required files in that directory
  3. run "git init" - This will initialise a local repository in that directory
  4. You can either add files one by or altogether
  5. git add filename or git add file*.*
  6. git commit -m "Message - Initial Commit" - this will add the files to your local repository that you initiated in step 3
  7. create file named ".gitIgnore"
